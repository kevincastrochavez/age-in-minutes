# Overview

I'm trying to expand my knowledge in Kotlin

I created an Age in Minutes application with a single view where you can select the date you were born (or pretty much any date you want) and get your age in minutes

The purpose of my application is to strengthen the fundamentals of Kotlin, the Calendar class, grabbing elements from the UI and formatting dates

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to create my Kotlin app

Kotlin is a multiplatform mobile language (shares the logic of your Android and iOS apps while keeping the UX native). It's safe and concise and is used by 60% of android developers
